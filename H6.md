# A) Analyzing h1.jpg  
I downloaded the target file from [here](https://hhmoodle.haaga-helia.fi/pluginfile.php/4346436/mod_folder/content/0/h1.jpg?forcedownload=1).  
After this I tried `file` and `strings` commands to analyze the target file.  
The `file` command wasn't really intresting, just that it is an jpeg file

But `strings` was a bit more intresting. The amount of data it spat out was quite large, but while skimming it I came a across some data that would suggest that this is a word file?

# B) Using binwalk to further analyze h1.jpeg  
I tried using binwalk for the program: `binwalk h1.jpeg`

I haven't used binwalk before so my analysis is a bit lacking, but there seems to be image data and some zipped xml documents.  
To extract the zip-files i tried binwalk with the `--extract` parameter  
I got a new file from it called _h1.jpeg.extracted, that contained all the xml file. In the file "document.xml" i could see all the text that was in it, but nothing else as i could not get the word document opened in a proper way.  
# C) Analyzing a programm from the FOSS (Free Android Open-Source) 
At first I navigated to the FOSS library in [GitHub](https://github.com/offa/android-foss) and chose the first one from the list, Ad-blocker Ad-Away.
I downloaded the apk file from the latest releases (Version 6.1.4) onto my machine and got to work.  
At first I tried to analyze it with JADX, i downloaded it to my machine: `sudo apt-get install jadx`  
Oh oh, I got an error
