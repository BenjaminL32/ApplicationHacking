# Crypto Challenge Set 1
## Convert hex to base64
In this challenge I had to convert a single hex string in to base 64.  
I have done a little coding in my younger days, so I was a bit rusty. I knew from our lessons that using the `base64.b64encode` function is propably the right call here, so I tried to use it.  
I unfortunately did not remeber any of the python syntax, so I had to ask chatGPT for some help how to do this.  
But after a bit of trial and error, I managed to get the the string converted to base64

## Fixed XOR
In thois challenge i had to do a bitwise XOR to two strings.  
At first I converted the two string in to binaries and saved them as variables a and b.  
Then tried doing the xorring, but ran in to a plethora of syntax errors so i once again asked chatGPT to help me with syntax and to explain to me what each part of the code did.  
Here is the answer  
```
import binascii
a = binascii.a2b_hex("1c0111001f010100061a024b53535009181c")
b = binascii.a2b_hex("686974207468652062756c6c277320657965")
    xor = bytes(x ^ y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    print(xor.decode())
```

The codebit that does the xor, pairs the two string with the `zip (a,b)` so that each bit from a corresponds to the same bit in b.  
Then the for loop goes over each bit and xors it with the corresponding bit.  
Then the `bytes` returns a new byte-string.  
Then lastly. `xor.decode()` converts the string into ASCII.  
And the answer i got was "the kid don't play"  
After doing this I re-read the assignement and figured that the assignement asked for a hex result, not ascii. So i added this piece of code so that i got it.  

`xxor = binascii.b2a_hex(xor).decode()/n print(xxor)`
