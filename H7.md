# Crypto Challenge Set 1
## Convert hex to base64
In this challenge I had to convert a single hex string in to base 64.  
I have done a little coding in my younger days, so I was a bit rusty. I knew from our lessons that using the `base64.b64encode` function is propably the right call here, so I tried to use it.  
I unfortunately did not remeber any of the python syntax, so I had to ask chatGPT for some help how to do this.  
But after a bit of trial and error, I managed to get the the string converted to base64
