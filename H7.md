# Crypto Challenge Set 1
## Convert hex to base64
In this challenge I had to convert a single hex string in to base 64.  
I have done a little coding in my younger days, so I was a bit rusty. I knew from our lessons that using the `base64.b64encode` function is propably the right call here, so I tried to use it.  
I unfortunately did not remeber any of the python syntax, so I had to ask chatGPT for some help how to do this.  
But after a bit of trial and error, I managed to get the the string converted to base64

## Fixed XOR
In thois challenge i had to do a bitwise XOR to two strings.  
At first I converted the two string in to binaries and saved them as variables a and b.  
Then tried doing the xorring, but ran in to a plethora of syntax errors so i once again asked chatGPT to help me with syntax and to explain to me what each part of the code did.  
Here is the answer  
```
import binascii
a = binascii.a2b_hex("1c0111001f010100061a024b53535009181c")
b = binascii.a2b_hex("686974207468652062756c6c277320657965")
    xor = bytes(x ^ y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    print(xor.decode())
```

The codebit that does the xor, pairs the two string with the `zip (a,b)` so that each bit from a corresponds to the same bit in b.  
Then the for loop goes over each bit and xors it with the corresponding bit.  
Then the `bytes` returns a new byte-string.  
Then lastly. `xor.decode()` converts the string into ASCII.  
And the answer i got was "the kid don't play"  
After doing this I re-read the assignement and figured that the assignement asked for a hex result, not ascii. So i added this piece of code so that i got it.  

`xxor = binascii.b2a_hex(xor).decode()/n print(xxor)`  

## Single-byte XOR cipher
Okay, I had no ******* clue how to even start this one. So chatGPT once again saved my ass.  
I asked chatGPT on how to do this and tried my best to understand how the code does this, but the code syntax is still a bit fuzzy.  
Here is the code that I got working.  
```import binascii

freq_chars = b'ETAOIN SHRDLUetaoinshrdlu '

def score_text(text):
    return sum(text.count(c) for c in freq_chars)

def single_byte_xor_brute_force(hex_str):
    data = binascii.a2b_hex(hex_str)
    candidates = []
    for key in range(256):
        xored = bytes([b ^ key for b in data])
        try:
            decoded = xored.decode('utf-8')
            score = score_text(xored)
            candidates.append((score, key, decoded))
        except:
            continue
    candidates.sort(reverse=True)
    return candidates

cipher_hex = "1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736"
results = single_byte_xor_brute_force(cipher_hex)

for score, key, text in results[:5]:
    print(f"Key: {key:02x} | Score: {score} | Text: {text}")
````

And the most propable answer I got was "Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon"  
I still have a lot of learning to do with python and coding in general to make sense of what the code does.
