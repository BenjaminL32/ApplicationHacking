# A) Lab1 debugging and fix
The program I am tring to debug can be downloaded from [here](https://terokarvinen.com/sovellusten-hakkerointi/lab1.zip).  
At first I downloaded the target file, unzipped it and looked at the source code in gdb_example1.c.  
Nothing obvious jumped at me so I tried to run the program.

I got some output and a segmentation fault. The code spits out "hello world" ciphered so that in the print the saved integer (3) is added to the ASCII code.  
Because I haven't used gdb before, I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq8l1_-QgAc&t=434s) tutorial video from youtube, and it was quite helpful in this.  
I started gbd, and ran the program while setting a breakpoint to main, then I just gave the "next" command until the failure.  
The failure came when trying to print out the bad message. There propably is a way more elegant way to fix this, but I just added quotations around the `NULL` in the line that prints out the bad message.

After running the fixed program, no faults were found.

# Lab2, finding the password and flag.  
There are quite a few different methods to do this, so I will try a few.  
First I opened the program in gdb, once again put a breakpoint in main, and ran it until it spit out the password.

After that I ran the program normally in terminal and gave it the password I got.

And the flag was gotten.  
We can also use the strings program to get the binaries and see if the password and flag can be found in there.  
<img width="303" height="55" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c70ed6f-8af7-4e39-9cf4-97097ad532ca" />  
And yes, they indeed could be found that way.  
There was also a different program in it called passtr2o, and i tried cracking it as well.  
The previous gimmicks did not work this time. Strings spat out total nonsense and gdb didn't just straight out give me the password.  
But I used gdb to try to look at the assember to see if it would provide any infromation, and it did reveal that there is some XORing happening.  
<img width="263" height="18" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2b8d764-ca99-4366-a153-5539b0965b0b" />  
So the password and flag are propably XORed.  
Unfortunately, this is as far as i got. I tried to set breakpoints to different parts of the code and read the registery values, but i did not get the password. I tried to open it with ghidra, but that got me nothing of value out of it (at least for me).
