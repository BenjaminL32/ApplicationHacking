## OWASP: OWASP Top 10: A01 Broken Access Control.  
- Broken access control is the most common vulnerability
- Expoliting this vulnerability can be as easy as modifying the URL
## Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf
- fuff is a tool to scan hidden directories in a web server
- You can find these manually, but fuff does it automatically
##  Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation
- Different types of access control are vertical, horizontal and context-based'
- Privilige escalation can be done in a variety of ways, all of them rely on modifying the URL in different ways
## Raportin kirjoittaminen
- The report must be repeatable following the report
- The report must be precise. No omitting information
- The report must be easy to read
- Refer to sources in a proper way.

# Breaking in to 010-staff-only: [Hack'n Fix](https://terokarvinen.com/hack-n-fix/)  
I started off by starting up a new virtual machine running debian bookworm 12.  
Next up, I got the latest updates and downloaded micro, wget and unzip  
`sudo apt-get update` 
</br>
`sudo apt-get -y install wget micro unzip`  
After that I downloaded the challenge from https://terokarvinen.com/hack-n-fix/teros-challenges.zip and unzipped it  
`wget https://terokarvinen.com/hack-n-fix/teros-challenges.zip`  
`unzip teros-challenges.zip`
To run the first challenge "staff-only.py", I had to install 2 required extensions, flask and flask sqlalchemy.
`sudo apt-get -y install python3-flask`  
`sudo apt-get -y install python3-flask-sqlalchemy`  
After all the prepwork was done, I started the challenge.

I navigated to the address given and started to think how I was going to get in.

At first I opened the web developer console and started looking around. I noticed that the only input value allowed was set to "number" so i changed that to text.  
After that I manipulated the "value" field in various ways, I tried to insert `OR 1=1--` but kept just gettin the "not found" code.  So I had to look a bit of instrucitons on what i was doing wrong.  
I consulted various websites on SQL syntax but the guide from Robin Niinimets finally gave me the answer, i was missin "'" from the front (https://askdatdude.github.io/diary/entries/diary.html?entry=SH24-002&week=)  
Now that the syntax was somewhat correct, I tried again and got this answer.

But this wasn't the answer we were looking for, so back to the drawing board it is.  
After consulting Hack'n Fix guide at the bottom of the page, I treid to insert the LIMIT function to get it to input a different result then just "foo"
I tried all different variations, that caused lots of internal server errors ( I think the cause was that returning more the one result causes an error)  
I studied the syntax, and figured that changing the offset one by one would at some point return the right one. And fortunately I was correct, adding `LIMIT 1,2` finally gave me the flag
