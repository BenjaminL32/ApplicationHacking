X) Hammond 2022: [Ghidra for Reverse Engineering (PicoCTF 2022 #42 'bbbloat')](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTD_ki86c9I)
- ltrace and strace are command line programs that are used to identify library calls during program run
- objdump can also be used to dump out some binaries.
- ghidra is a reverse engineering software that can be used to analyze a program and it makes guesses about the source code.
# A) Installing ghidra.  
I installed ghidra with the following command:  
`sudo apt-get install ghidra`  
I made a new project file in ghidra called H4

# B) Reversing binaries to C  
I started by importing the packd program to ghidra (from [here](https://terokarvinen.com/sovellusten-hakkerointi/)  
After that i started the analyzer tool and a prompt informed me that that the file has not been analyzed, so I opened analysis option and checked all the boxes that werent prototypes.  
The software was a bit buggy, I had to open the tool 3 times until I was prompted to analyze.

After the analysis was done, i was given the analyzed source code.

I gave the iVar1 variable a new name, password.  
<img width="302" height="181" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fe99a4c-75c4-429c-a387-1de683d41eca" />  
As we can see from the analyzed source code, the password is "piilos-AnAnAs"  
<img width="307" height="80" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2414aea-9583-4f54-bf80-394ce1070a99" />  
# C) Modifying passtr code to accept any password.  
In this I will run ghidra analysis for passtr program to get the source-code and modify it to accept any passwords but the original.  
First, i imported the file to ghidra. When that was done I ran the analysis for the program.  
<img width="674" height="361" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4df3ae2d-e720-41f9-8afb-73a922c6008b" />  
Now that i had source code in front of me, I modified the if statement used for checking the password to return 0 for all passwords exept the original.  
I do this by modifying the assembler code from JNZ to JZ so that the if statement jums over the right password, but run the statement from wrong passwords.  
<img width="669" height="349" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f584d6c5-d4e9-461d-88c1-47215820f6e4" />  
After the modification I exported the modified program and ran it to test it.  
<img width="669" height="349" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a2ee941-c1f8-4db5-9e54-b5dc26453ec9" />  
As we can see, the modification works now.  
# D) Nora CrackMe practice targets.  
For this I hade to turn the c source in to binaries. I did this with the command `make crackme01` (I only did this for one source for now)  
<img width="556" height="102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a97e326d-3534-46fb-9c9c-cb755640710e" />  
# E) Nora crackme01
I imported the compiled program from the previous assignment to ghidra and analyzed it. Fortunately the analyzed source contained the password  
<img width="1372" height="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e92883db-085f-4485-8f56-c635d642873d" />  
After i got the password i tried it to see that it actually works.  
<img width="247" height="55" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c0224b0-b335-4fa3-95af-ab9570793536" />  
# F) Nora crackme01e  
I started off with importing the compiled program to gidhra.  
<img width="376" height="286" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bef9e034-5c7a-42c5-a5e9-6c7672122437" />  
And here is the result  
<img width="208" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afda53a4-854c-4a51-9c46-520e42f0baf3" />  
At first i tried the password that was in the source, but i got the following error.  
<img width="197" height="34" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee4103f3-e113-4529-bfad-e99893829732" />  
Okei, so the password contains an exclamation mark and its trying to run some parameteres after that (just a guess).  
So I tried to put the password in quotations so that it would be treated as a string.  
<img width="208" height="31" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaa7368a-e2f5-41c9-a24c-d72094ca4a65" />  
Ok so that did not work.  
After googling the error i found this [stackoverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39708594/expect-script-event-not-found-while-passing-in-argument)  
I realized that my idea was right, I just had the wrong quotation marks. I tried again with the right syntax.

# F) Nora crackme02. 
As usual, i import the compiled program to ghidra.  
<img width="385" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cd3e64a-f5d2-4d64-8429-673402d0582d" />  
Unfortunately, after about half an hour of trying to make sense of how the program works, i had to give up because of time constraints. Hopefully we can go over this in the classroom.
