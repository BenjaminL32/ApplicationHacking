# A) Downloading the challange and trying out strings.  
At first I downloaded the the challange package [ezbin-challanges](https://terokarvinen.com/loota/yctjx7/ezbin-challenges.zip) from terokarvinen.com  
I unzipped it and ran the passtr executable in the files, and it prompted me to give a password. Because I did not know the password, I examined the executable via strings  
`strings passtr`

And just like that, strings gave me the password i was looking for. I tried the password and was given the flag.

# B) New version of the program
Unofrtunately, I have almost 0 coding experience, so I was unable to complete this assignement.
