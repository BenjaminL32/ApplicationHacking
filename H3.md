# A) Downloading the challange and trying out strings.  
At first I downloaded the the challange package [ezbin-challanges](https://terokarvinen.com/loota/yctjx7/ezbin-challenges.zip) from terokarvinen.com  
I unzipped it and ran the passtr executable in the files, and it prompted me to give a password. Because I did not know the password, I examined the executable via strings  
`strings passtr`

And just like that, strings gave me the password i was looking for. I tried the password and was given the flag.

# B) New version of the program
Unofrtunately, I have almost 0 coding experience, so I was unable to complete this assignement.  
# C) Trying to crack packd
At first I tried the `strings` and `file` tools to see the binaries, but as this assignement was a bit harder, this didnÂ´t give me the password, only the partial flag.  
I found [this](https://medium.com/geek-talk/how-to-reverse-engineer-your-first-binary-15a047c48649) website that taught me a few new commands to try.  
These didn't get me far, but the xxd command gave me a hexdump of the file, and it gave me the infromation that the files was packed using UPX

After a bit of googling, i found out that UPX can be unpacked with UPX, and fortunately it is installed on kali by default. So I tried to unpack it with the command `upx -d packd`

After the file was unpacked, I tried `strings` again, an wahoo, the password and flag was found :)
