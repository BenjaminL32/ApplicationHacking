# C) My thoughts on podcast: Laatulöpinät 30: Tietoturvallisuus ohjelmistokehityksessä.
Claim: "No software is ever fully secure"  
I do agree with this sentiment, because human error is always possible when creating software  
Claim:"Corporate jargon is born from necessity"  
I agree that there is a place for corporate jargon, but I think that the less we have it the better. Corporate jargon is not accessible to larger audiences and makes learning a field harder.  
# D) Making a risk management plan for myself.  
I will be making a risk management plan for my computer.  
The risk of operating a computer are as follows:  
1. Loss of data  
2. Physical damage  
3. Intrusion

To mitigate these risks, i can take the following steps.  
1. User training on how to properly use a computer and its software so that it does't cause risks.  
2. Backing-up data, so that when the device is destroyed or its data is lost, it is recoverable.  
3. Updating software as soon as possible to avoid possible vulnerabilities.
